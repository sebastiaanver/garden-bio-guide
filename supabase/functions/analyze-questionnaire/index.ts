Measures details:
#	Measure	Description	Key Benefits	Implementation Highlights
1	Hedgehog House	Shelter for hedgehogs to overwinter and breed.	ü¶î Biodiversity, natural pest control, wildlife habitat	Place in a sheltered, dry spot covered with leaves and twigs. No milk; cat food can be given if needed.
2	Plant Selection	Using native, layered vegetation (low plants, shrubs, trees) for year-round biodiversity.	üåø Biodiversity, cooling, soil health, ecological management	Use native, pollinator-friendly, and pesticide-free plants. Ensure year-round flowering.
3	Vegetable Garden	Growing food without chemical pesticides; improving soil health.	üçÖ Biodiversity, soil health, sustainability	Use companion planting (e.g., marigolds for pest control), compost, and crop rotation.
4	Pond	Water feature with shallow edges for wildlife habitat and ecosystem balance.	üíß Biodiversity, water storage, ecological function	Use native water plants, avoid fish to prevent nutrient overload, maintain clean edges.
5	Natural Boundaries	Using hedgerows, trees, and shrubs instead of fences for natural separation.	üå≥ Biodiversity, habitat connectivity, wind protection	Plant mixed hedgerows with species like hawthorn, blackthorn, or willow. Avoid impermeable barriers.
6	Trees & Orchards	Planting trees, including fruit trees, for ecosystem stability and food sources.	üçè Biodiversity, habitat, shade, carbon capture	Use native trees; avoid excessive pruning. Incorporate a protective hedge around orchards.
7	Wadi & Flat Bank	Creating water retention areas for flood control and biodiversity.	üí¶ Water storage, biodiversity, cooling	Design for natural water drainage; plant water-tolerant species such as reeds and sedges.
8	Flower Strips	Planting native wildflower meadows to support pollinators and insects.	ü¶ã Pollinators, biodiversity, habitat	Use native wildflower seed mixes, minimize mowing, avoid fertilizers.
9	Wildlife Corners	Leaving areas untidy (piles of wood, stones, compost) to support small animals & insects.	ü¶é Biodiversity, habitat, food web support	Create brush piles, leave dead wood, avoid chemical treatments.
10	Phased Mowing	Rotational mowing to allow insects and plants to thrive.	üå± Pollinators, biodiversity, soil health	Mow in sections, leave some areas undisturbed. Remove cuttings to avoid over-fertilization.
11	Permeable Surfaces	Reducing paved areas to increase soil permeability.	üåç Biodiversity, water retention, soil health	Replace impermeable surfaces with gravel, grass pavers, or permeable stones.
12	Owl Nest Boxes	Providing safe nesting sites for owls that control rodent populations.	ü¶â Biodiversity, natural pest control	Install in barns or trees, ensure predator protection (e.g., against martens).
13	Bat Boxes	Safe roosting spots for bats, which help control insect populations.	ü¶á Biodiversity, natural pest control	Place boxes on buildings or trees near feeding areas (e.g., hedgerows, water bodies).
14	Birdhouses	Nesting sites for various bird species.	üê¶ Biodiversity, pest control, habitat support	Provide different house types for different species. Avoid placing near high-traffic areas.
15	Bee Hotels	Nesting sites for wild bees to support pollination.	üêù Pollinators, biodiversity, food security	Use untreated wood, drill holes of varying diameters, place in sunny areas.

Return a JSON object with three properties:
1. recommendations: array of recommended measure IDs (numbers 1-15)
2. environmentScores: object mapping measure IDs to environment scores (1-5)
3. scoreReasonings: object mapping measure IDs to strings explaining the specific reasoning for each environment score based on the questionnaire responses

Example response format:
{
  "recommendations": [1, 2, 8],
  "environmentScores": {"1": 4, "2": 5, "8": 3},
  "scoreReasonings": {
    "1": "Based on the garden size of 200m¬≤ and existing hedges, this would provide excellent shelter for hedgehogs",
    "2": "The south-facing aspect and well-draining soil make this location perfect for native plant diversity",
    "8": "Limited space but good sun exposure allows for effective wildflower strips along borders"
  }
}

Provide detailed, specific reasonings that reference the actual questionnaire responses.
The response must be valid JSON.`;
